# mininetShortestPath
RYU application to find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm

toponew.py contains the topology configuration being used for this project.

application_code.py is my attempt to create shortest path and longest path for packet routing along the provided topology.

The weights of the links have been self declared as constants.

Note that I have tried to provide shortest path for certain host communications and longest path for other host communications, creating a miniature sized data centre model.

The Dijkstra's algorithm used is from the following link:

Feedback and corrections if any are most welcome.
Cheers:)
